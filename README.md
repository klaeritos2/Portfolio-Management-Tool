# Portfolio-Management-Tool
Project for the course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level" at the University of St. Gallen

The provided code consists of several functions with the aim of doing stock portfolio analysis. 
The first part of the code calculates the best stock portfolio allocation based on either the optimal Sharpe Ratio or the lowest risk. It also shows a scatterplot of a simulation of multiple portfolio strategies and highlights the most optimal ones. This is all done through the concepts of modern portfolio theory. 
The second part of the tool focuses on calculating the Value at Risk over a certain timeframe, given a confidence interval. This VaR calculation takes the previously calculated optimal portfolio allocation as input. 
The last tool then shows the top three most recent news headlines for the stocks given. This also includes the links to then be able to further read up on a topic

The interface itself is designed to facilitate interaction with the portfolio optimization codes. It is designed to be as user-friendly as possible and mitigated any errors that might arise through wrong inputs

Overall, the project combines calculations of portfolio performance with optimization to assist the user in making informed investment decisions.
