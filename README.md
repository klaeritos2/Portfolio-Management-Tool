# Portfolio-Management-Tool
Project for the course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level" at the University of St. Gallen

The provided code consists of several functions with the aim of doing stock portfolio analysis. The first part of the code calculates the portfolio performance based on stock inputs from the user. Second part of the code focuses on optimization of the portfolio based on stock inputs from the user. The optimization finds the optimal allocation between the stocks, the annualized return, and annualized volatility. 

The interface is designed to facilitate interaction with the portfolio optimization codes. It contains functions that enable the user to input their choses and receive a portfolio optimized allocation. Design of the interface is simple to make it user friendly.  

Overall, the project combines calculations of portfolio performance with optimization to assist the user in making informed investment decisions.
